Hi,
When sagar was saying "Happy Family" in context to mine, it was not so years back.Mine was a family struggling without peace due to my husband's addiction. That is the reason i had done MCA and M.Pil at a later stage.
       But there was no self pity nor the give up attitude.Now my children have come up beyond my expectations and in my career too I was able to do very well.My husband has changed so much and we are a happy family now.
         Just to say that struggles can be overcome .Be positive and cling on to God.
This is my life lesson for you besides the other lessons we had learnt.Even if one of you benefit now or in the future and be positive and have the never give up attitude , it's great.:)
